`class RadialAxis extends BaseAxis`

https://www.chartjs.org/docs/2.7.3/axes/radial/

RadialAxis inherits all the properties from [BaseAxis]({{ "/docs/api/axes.html" | relative_url }})

Radial axes are used specifically for the radar and polar area chart types. These axes overlay the chart area, rather than being positioned on one of the edges



## API
